# Contributing to the SUMO challenge API

The Starcraft Defogger is primarily a codebase to help users reproduce the
results of our paper. As such, we do not anticipate significant ongoing
development in this project.  However, the software is not perfect, and we
encourage participants to provide bug fixes if they identify any.  We want to
make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.
